## About labeling functions
Generally, labeling functions can be:
- Pattern matching, such as in regular expressions
- Third party models, e.g. sentiment classifiers or legacy systems
- Lookups in lists or databases, such as a list of known organizations
- General heuristics, such as grammar checks
- Metadata-based functions, e.g. predicting on the value of other attributes
