# template-functions
In this repository, you can find sample labeling functions for classification and extraction tasks.

## Usage
There are two `README`s, one for [classifiers](classification/README.md), one for [extractors](extraction/README.md). Depending on your task at hand, please look into the respective `README`.

## About labeling functions
Generally, labeling functions can be:
- Pattern matching, such as in regular expressions
- Third party models, e.g. sentiment classifiers or legacy systems
- Lookups in lists or databases, such as a list of known organizations
- General heuristics, such as grammar checks
- Metadata-based functions, e.g. predicting on the value of other attributes
- Crowd labeling (we're not going to focus on this here)
